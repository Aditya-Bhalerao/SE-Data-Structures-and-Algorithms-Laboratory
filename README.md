**Group A :-**

###### Experiment No. 1 - 

Consider telephone book database of N clients. Make use of a hash table implementation
to quickly look up client‘s telephone number. Make use of two collision handling
techniques and compare them using number of comparisons required to find a set of
telephone numbers

###### Experiment No. 2 - 

Implement all the functions of a dictionary (ADT) using hashing and handle collisions
using chaining with / without replacement.
Data: Set of (key, value) pairs, Keys are mapped to values, Keys must be comparable, Keys
must be unique
Standard Operations: Insert(key, value), Find(key), Delete(key) 

**Group B :-**

###### Experiment No. 5 - 

A book consists of chapters, chapters consist of sections and sections consist of
subsections. Construct a tree and print the nodes. Find the time and space requirements
of your method. 

###### Experiment No. 6 - 

Beginning with an empty binary search tree, Construct binary search tree by inserting the
values in the order given. After constructing a binary tree -
i. Insert new node
ii. Find number of nodes in longest path from root
iii. Minimum data value found in the tree
iv. Change a tree so that the roles of the left and right pointers are swapped at every
node
v. Search a value

###### Experiment No. 7 - 

Construct an expression tree from the given prefix expression eg. +--a*bc/def and
traverse it using postordertraversal(non recursive) and then delete the entire tree. 

**Group C :-**

###### Experiment No. 13 - 

Represent a given graph using adjacency matrix/list to perform DFS and using adjacency
list to perform BFS. Use the map of the area around the college as the graph. Identify the
prominent land marks as nodes and perform DFS and BFS on that.

###### Experiment No. 14 - 

There are flight paths between cities. If there is a flight between city A and city B then
there is an edge between the cities. The cost of the edge can be the time that flight take
to reach city B from A, or the amount of fuel used for the journey. Represent this as a
graph. The node can be represented by airport name or name of the city. Use adjacency
list representation of the graph or use adjacency matrix representation of the graph.
Check whether the graph is connected or not. Justify the storage representation used. 
**Group D :-**

###### Experiment No. 18 - 

Given sequence k = k1 <k2 < … <kn of n sorted keys, with a search probability pi for each
key ki . Build the Binary search tree that has the least search cost given the access
probability for each key? 

**Group E :-**

###### Experiment No. 21 - 

Implement the Heap/Shell sort algorithm implemented in Java demonstrating heap/shell
data structure with modularity of programming language

**Group F :-**

###### Experiment No. 23 - 

Department maintains a student information. The file contains roll number, name,
division and address. Allow user to add, delete information of student. Display
information of particular employee. If record of student does not exist an appropriate
message is displayed. If it is, then the system displays the student details. Use sequential
file to main the data.
